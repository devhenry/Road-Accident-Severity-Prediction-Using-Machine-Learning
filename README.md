# Road-Accident-Severity-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Prediction of road accidents severity using machine learning techniques, in order to reduce their occurrence and mitigate the associated risks.

This machine learning project addresses the global concern of road traffic fatalities and injuries by developing a predictive model to forecast accident severity, which is defined by the accident's impact on traffic flow rather than injury severity.

Trained on a large dataset of U.S. accidents that incorporates accident reports, weather conditions, and road infrastructure, the study compared supervised learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classifier.

The researchers determined that the Random Forest algorithm offered the best performance in terms of accuracy. The actionable output of this Predictive Model includes; identifying high-risk locations, termed "black spots," and providing a foundation for offering real-time risk information to road users, ultimately helping traffic management systems mitigate risks and improve overall road safety.
